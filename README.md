# Unity_Card_Game_Deck_Editor
This is a project I made in January 2016. It was the first program I'd written utilizing databases, where this project uses SQLite. I also made it to refresh myself with Unity, as I initially used it when I wasn't necessarily confident in my programing skills. With this project, you can add, remove cards to the deck, and search for cards by name, ability and type. The features that currently aren't implemented are saving decks and loading decks, but they will be available in the future. I also plan on rewriting some of the code, as I'm currently not happy with some of my implementation. I plan to use this for a game I wish to create in the future.
