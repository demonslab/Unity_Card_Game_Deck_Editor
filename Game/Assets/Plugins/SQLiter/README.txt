Setup
------------------------------
1. Import Package
2. Create Empty GameObject in Scene
	2a.  Add SQLiter.cs script to gameobject
3. Create Empty GameObject in Scene
	3a.  Add LoomManager.cs script to gameobject
4. Run.  SQLiter will have created a SQLite DB in the Assets/SQLiter/Databases folder.

From here you can delete the DB if you like.  Edit the SQLiter.cs file, view
the way it saves/updates/inserts values, deletes items, queries stuff, how to use
the LoomManager for multithreading, etc.  This is just a template of how to set things
up, along with the necessary .DLLs and basic code.  It's hardly an advanced view of things,
but the initial setup has been done.

SQLite Copyright
------------------------------
All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process (for example the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the SQLite library.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.
